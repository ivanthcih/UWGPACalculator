# UWGPACalculator

FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
My project will be a GPA Calculator (with weight in consideration) based on the UW undergraduate grading system,
it will calculate both cumulative and quarterly GPAs. It is intended to be used by undergraduate students attending
any of the University of Washington campuses who want their present standing GPAs.
DESIGN OVERVIEW

● It will use:
○ Scanner as the program requires user input.
○ A while loop to keep the questions in the loop while the user is answering.
○ Multiple questions regarding cumulative or quarterly GPA, number of classes, and credit value in
each class.
● It will showcase all the classes for one (or multiple) quarters and their respective credits and GPA values.
● Put weight into consideration depending on the amount of credit a class has.
● Have users interact with a text-based interface or graphical user interface.
